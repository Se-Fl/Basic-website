Basic Website 

This is a basic webpage made with html and css, build around a made-up company.

I didn't include media queries for different screen sizes yet so it may not scale up to large monitors well, and for sure won't scale down to mobile viewports well.

To view the site, download the html, css, and image files into a folder on your computer. Creat a folder named "images" within your initial folder (the one where the files have been downloaded into) and move the images into it. The webpage can now be viewed by opening the html file in a browser (I used the latest version of Chrome)
